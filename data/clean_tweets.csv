i am very glad i took care of own rescheduling now that ua from ogg was cancelled flightled;0
tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message how can i tell if it went through;0
is flight going to sit on the tarmac forever;0
one of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes her tone amp;0
thats why i blame your company because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons;0
i wanna be grand staff;2
sf crew lack a lot of customer service lax employees are a lot better wonder why;0
thats why i missed my flight if the flight had been held for minutes i would have made it i watched it pull away from the gate;0
also didnt ice the frozen metal walkway wasted minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs;0
your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the tarmac didnt have a gate agent once we got a gate;0
i wanna be ride united airline i love airplane;2
after days flight cancelled flightled another delay for hours united gave me a food voucher thats how much they value my time;0
checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass airlinesecurity;0

actually the flight was just cancelled flightled;0
i am a loyal premier platinum member but the lack of communication was really bad also i dont see that it has taken off yet;0
thanks for having changed me managed to arrive with only hours of delay and exhausted;0
this is the nd time i was rebooked wdelays and for reasons unrelate flightd to weather how do i go about requesting a flight voucher;0
if you consider mins for bags pm on a sunday night as fast as they can you should reconsider what you think that means;0
its the horrible attitude from staff after not just the delay not the level of service or respect one expects from united;0
why do you want me to be loyal if dont let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead;0
ua flight sfo to lax took my carry on at gate im group overhead bins are empty;1
on top of that i paid for st class and my wife got stuck in coach;0
ph the pat answers are bs after i was denied boarding it sat at the gate until your employees totally suck;0
over the last week united has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life disgusting united;0
hrs since flight landed and zero info on my missing bag rough eta would be hugely helpful restore some confidence;0
big surprise nogate waiting for our plane same fucken issues everything i fly you fail worstairlineever;0

im desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this cancelled flightleddelayed flight unacceptable ord;0

why announce it is for rollers at all if i want to put a coat in there isnt that my choice how about all gate checked thx;0
youre my early frontrunner for best airline oscars;2
bags left behind because plane overweight be great if knew as soon as we landed instead letting us wait minutes with no info;0
you are a famp;0

worked like a charm bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim welldone goodflight friendlysky;2
will lose my bag but wont give me free pretzels frauds;0
you are trying to charge me bucks because you lowered your award tickets and i want to get my hard earn points back total bs;0
does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time gottogetbetter;0
apart from being on hold for over hours and having talked to people and the problem still not resolved;0
typical caned response from ua fix your crappy performing last placedranked airline in this century;0
is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor;0
customer service is the worst hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold;0
was forced to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price felt like a bait and switch tactic;0
love how you dont give a shit about people who tried to be loyal but you screw them every way till sunday glad ive stayed away;0
tried a different flight iahmnl flights are advertised for but are not bookable due to partner error;0
it will be on a different airline;0
and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved;0

going on days tomorrow and i still havent received my bag from my flight to toronto would love to see some seriousness here;0
is there nothing you can do for me no compensation at all given the circumstances i feel like there must be something you can do;0
there is a disconnect between your pr group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground liars united;0
here we go again of segments sfonew york rt were delayed over hrs each why do you suck so badmaybe another line of bus;0
you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from maui to san francisco poor communication bad help in getting connections;0
if you dont like delayed bags why do you let it happen so much;0
the delay is due to customer service for people what about the disservice you provided for flightfail hourdelay;0
he is so excellent and so reliable happycustomer;2

i wouldnt describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience to help you might find my baggage you lost amp;0
and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best;0
is that all that matters not the fact that were at a different destination we were put through a tremendous amount of stress;0

absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers isnt there anyone actively monitoring your cust serve this is unreal;0

youre customer service is unbelievably bad abysmal ive been on the phone for well over hrs tonight hung up on by yr ppl x;0
you can read the full story when i submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight and why we are sleeping in dia;0

allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane;0
no wheelchairs;0
no commitment to a good turnaround an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance;0

we were told by united to carry overcarry back for the refund;1
no i had to leave for work would have not been possible so i would love to have this replaced now;1
i feel completely cheated i read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there;0

if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff;0
itproblems with the link thparty;0
i feel very well informed yes the flight is indeed delayed thank you;0
why do i pay more for coach plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me;0

your mileageplus signup page is broken;0
for wifi just so i can tell my family im gonna be late flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours;0

thanks;2
hypocrisy rt im sorry were not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for kp;0
i shouldnt have to spend my own on a hotel because of a weather delay the weather being something completely out of my control;0
eventually you should approach bags like they get it;0
what if my nyc flight is delayed and i miss my connection to sacramento from chicago;0
said they would give us a refund days late flightr no refund;0
how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for hrs not convinced your company is safe for flt;0
we showed up to our flight several hours early tried to call amp;0
if your policy changed you must advise at the time of purchase same if you choose to vary it by airport we want a full refund;0
wanted to but you cancelled flightled my tickets they were too special i guess even for united;0
im for flight booking problems without major problems isnt bad;0
dont check your baggage if you dont have to they will lose it;0
im hoping we dont miss our lax ito connection not looking forward to being stuck at lax overnight with our teamagain;0
well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated we travel between canada amp;0
how can you not know after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded the planes weight;0
you make it hard to fly with you delayed over an hour and now the plane is turning around amp;0
serious firing needs to happen at hnl they broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine;0
call customer service and of course they just say theres nothing we can do and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line;0

if you have had any issues with united airlines please retweet paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead;0
just tried to log in and was told email log in not currently available;0
so why did you cancelled flight tickets for thousands of people when you didnt like the exchange rate doublestandards;0
do you have an email address i can write my account to might be less likely to disappear;1
so i wasted mins filling in online forms you are telling me you didnt receive how do i know this wont happen this time;0
from amsterdam to ewr;1
stuck here in iah waiting on flight to honolulu for hours due to maintenance issues could we have gotten a new plane fail;0
what kind of hypocrisy is that only cancelled flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage united;0
no the entire problem here is that i was never sent anything via email and only given a flight booking problems number over the phone;0
calling that number was useless heading to the airport now to pick up my bags this whole situation seems like a real joke;0
they couldnt get me first class on any of their flights so i just rebooked myself;0
but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disastertravelingwithsmallkids;1

we would have been up in the air by now now our new plane weve been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays;0
you delay all my flights then you redirect my gate then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have;0
our fleets on fleek this happened;1
definitely no note from whoever stole from me;0
but the hour policy when i called and they said i didnt report it soon enough what would have changed if i had noticed sooner;0
hopefully that will help someone in the future would there have been a different procedure if i had discovered the theft sooner;0
i did that as soon as i realized will they try to figure out who is stealing from peoples bags security cameras anything;0
i did but since i was stranded in syr without a ride i missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter hours;0
absolutely no worries im just never flying with you again ever even i have to hitch hike cross country passengersarepeople;0
dont lose my luggage;0
you just directed me to your mobile website where is the direct link get it together;0

wtf stuck at jfk for hrs in a delay to boston cuz u say snow no snow on weather map wtf;0
thank you for getting me home and despite all odds i have reunited with my delinquent southwest luggage now homeward;2
words staff training what a joke;0
is a joke missed my connecting flight by minutes last flight of the day and they dont hold it minutes;0
sorry should have specified i meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal;1
any idea whats going on at terminal five at jfk seems to be zero traffic movement;0
very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept i nearly had to beg get just for a courtesy report;0
ok thanks safety first;2
apparently the plane was delayed coming up from san juan monsoon there today;0
thats ok it just sure seemed like it when jetblue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching haha;1

even tho the extra lbs are still going on the plane just as a carry on where is the sense what do you say to fat people;0
i thought being a mosaic member had perks the best part is instead of checking the extra lbs im carrying it on;0

if only the show was on the flight no abc oh well ill live nexttime andthewinneris;0
ill call in the morning too upset right now;0
im still waiting no answer;0
ok thanks for your help;2
love you guys;2
the amount of money i spent on hotels for a week bc of flight cancelled flightlation another flight doesnt make up for the money lost;0
being told jfk had a hour delay this am which is reason for my delay now it cant be that hard to notify with hours notice;0
by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk;0
keep waiting time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback;0
youre still the best;2
please give jetblue all the permissions in the world im missing the oscars right now and its awful whyabcwhy;2
thanks so the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather relate flightd problems;0
ill be checking often most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds geeks and badly dressed;1
i am less concerned about the delay than i am about not being notified until i looked at the board that my flight was delayed;0
thanks i made it;2
after boarding flight the captain informs that he could exceed the hrs regulation and turned the plane around incredible;0
thanks for the quick response fingers crossed the plane gets here then;2
considering accessibility is an absolute must equality;0
how do we watch the oscars though right now no abc on flight missingtheoscars;0
thank you fingers crossed;2
ooookay thats silly of you guess were watching the oscars purely on twitter reactions tonight oscars;0

im dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight in santo domingo have been treated hrs to board the plane and no info given;0
id appreciate that would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that i be allowed to announce over intercom;1
if you want we can keep you updated on whos wearing who amp;1
i did they have no idea where it is;0
thanks but still annoying especially if i miss my flight can i tweet at the tsa;0
hey jetblue still waiting to hear where you lost my surfboard between jfk and bqn airports;0
your gif game is strong;0
well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility;0
flight den to jfk already hrs delayed any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc;0
why close prechk at pm on a sunday at jfk annoying;0
your crew didnt say it was about safety if they say that i was glad to stay check the information you give to the costumers;0
you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in south florida bc of your disorganization getittogether;0
im going to write a post on about the experience your customer service has tanked jetblue;0
still no response from ceo i guess he is at the oscars i bet his flight was on time justwrong;0
okay names of sj crew are alamo tatiana keep telling me to hold then leave desk ali told me he couldnt help bc going on break;0
aha ok thanks was worried there might not be a seat at all will do it at the airport tomorrow then;2

thanks for the update preciate it hope it gets here been delayed days getting back;0
yes they are working on it hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home;0
wellmy paid tickets have no assigned seats at all so essentially i wont be on this flight unless i pay more;0
if seats arent guaranteed why do we pay for them when i called the rep said some other people booked our seats;0
thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter excellent customer service and focus;2

this response doesnt correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated;0
been at dca at pm still here at am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane absolutely worse experience;0
it was almost hours late flight due to mechanical;0
never flying usairways again horrible experience terrible customer service;0
mobile boarding pass email;1
we willsunday just a few days away;2
i am following you now;1
unacceptable you knew the pilot wouldnt be able to complete the trip wasted all of our time;0
i have been on three planes for flight and still havent left the ground bad service sad;0
then told to offload because the captain was over hours this has been a terrible experience;0
why were we loaded onto the plane hours late flight mind you made to sit for minutes;0
why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period unacceptable;0
offloading the plane this is ridiculous;0
were excited to have you fly with us jb when will this be spring break;2
still just sitting here nobody has said anything whats up;1
that is actually not true you can get a seat online after a big hassle that policy is totally dishonest and misleading faa;0
i will thank you for at least tweeting me back better than most;2
that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us;0
thats incorrect four people last flight of the night with our bags horriblecustomerservice;0
exicted to be flying with yall soon;2
and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking buttons;1
the fact that you are making customers pay to choose a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors;0
ill do that in addition to reviewing on my blog your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than;0
your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide shameonyou usairwayssucks;0
worst experience ever with you guyssee my blog tomorrow on my experience maybe you can help make it better;0
now the freezing bus is just doing circles;0
please explain i have plenty of time since im stranded;0
i doubt that its p amp;0
why does it cost to change a ticket when it only cost to purchase a new ticket;0
sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane what is up;0
we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary;0
doesnt want me to get home;0
they dont stand alone for me i bought tix based on usair confirmed flight what good is confirmation if you change it anyway;0
dcagt;0
i bet you dont but im the paying customer here i know how to check for flight delays thank you;0
i cant even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive forcing me to purchase a new ticket;0
oh great after a hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving flight has been awful;0
thats the st sorry i received from your company the least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge;0
never flying with you guys again extremely disorganized and too many delays;0
my buddies are currently delayed hours and counting in dca on their ways to cae for a golf week any compensation flydelta;0
flights was the delay flight was my missed connection help;0
the flight that i did not connect to was;0
even when i do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so wont be that difficult am sure disappointed;0
yes not sure how you guys dont know gate is occupied and keep us waiting;0
wow your miles program is ripoffquick ticket fee i hope you all end up on unemployment;0
bos gt;0
sitting on the tarmac waiting to deplane minutes the level of service ive come to expect;0
you gladly take the loyal customers money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused;0
the least you could do is make up for what you have caused you are ruining peoples memories you should be ashamed;0
st a late flight plane then missing flight crew then maintenance problems gates switched times you call this customer service;0
due to your expensive change fees either out of all the airlines we chose yours all do you could screw us stranded no help;0
we cant afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home turns out we cant afford to go home;0
but its not their fault because their policy says they at least got us to our destination really;1
ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight and now we are stranded;0

my flight was cancelled flightled yesterday and moved to today then while at my stop in dc my flight is delayed due to lack of crew us;0
looking forward to some friends and family time in arizona;1
no they dont i think i already said that no one responds its an auto response wait is this an auto response;0
first class all the way headed to;2
started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck;0
us;0
i tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over mins please hold we dont care;0
you see now that is a lie they auto respond with insulting email sucks;0
your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help i appreciate the hard work amp;2
thanks for giving away my seat another fine job;2
how can i be stuck on a plane due to snow in boston when its not actually snowing in boston usair flight us;0
ive been waiting for desk for and on hold min and countingphoto of desk agent on phone not flattering;0
thanks;2
you have cancelled flighted our flights times over the past daysand the experience has been the worstnever again;0
thanks to betty working gate at ilm and lovely gate agents here in clt helping me get home phx tonight instead of tomorrow;2
i realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting cancelled flighted please prioritize ur passengers and help them;0
how does that help me when i get no response from there usairwayssucks;0
team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged not happy blizzard;0
surprisingly quick response time by you and them thanks;2
stop cancelled flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers strandedinnashville;0
strikes againlost bags and two of them theworst;0
had cancelled flight my trip to la bc weather was easy but us air is making me pay to use the credit never again;0
whats the point of a baggage claim ticket if they dont scan it for tracking;0
no access to dividend miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back late flightr frustrated livepersonplease;0
you cant even track my bag to see where it is its like its disappeared;0
cant get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles its been over a month since travel amp;0
is there gonna be a better day to call ive called on separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person;0
i spent more on the room amp;0
i ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that i had to spend;0
i asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service;0
only to come home a day late flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage;0
doubt it gate x is a cluster and every agent encounter i saw including one with me was outright rude just very put off;0
i have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport;0
the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do;0
so mad i cant even believe you guys cancelled flight my connecting flight after i leave the first stop amp;0
priorities should have been made considering a pending snow storm why delay a flight for an hour amp;0
i experienced what defines customer service on flt a flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges;0
ive done everything still no luck in finding my bag i dont understand how my bag could have been misplaced very upsetting;0
that wasnt my q but thanks wondering why youre the only ones i disguised yours to not call you out;0
turns into with such difficulty to past loyal customer as a aa platinum flyer usair couldnt be more unhelpful why;0
yes but i will nvr fly w i missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on ft couldnt see my father be they put him in a coma;0
minutes to put my tsa number in mins and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct;0
so i would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone usairwayssucks;0
really so what does that mean usairwayssucks;0
thanks can you help remind the agents its ok ps heard rumors of a streaming wifi tvmovie service you might be installing;2
nope done was supposed to get home at pm and didnt get home until midnight neveragain;0
the only way to assist is to actually answer the phone;0
would it kill you to give me seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold;0
would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation;0
would it kill you to not let miles expire;0
would it kill you to let me know how many minutes i might be on hold;0
a totaled not happy not at all;0
i have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked replys usairwaysssuck;0
the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for hours is i dont really know what happened;0
thanks;2
my number is cant waitlol usairsucks;0
have him call me i cant wait to see if anything happens your service really sucksusairwayssucks;0
she also appreciated having her very own hashtag lucycat;2

is it possible to earn dividend miles for a passenger that is not me even if i am purchasing the tickets;1
i hope so too thank you for your help she traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase;0
would you consider honoring the original fare price if i were to try flight booking problems the ticket again;0
booked an award ticket recently now same ticket is less miles how do i contact you without using the online form or phone;0
you are the best follow me please;2
would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible;0
thats ok just know that ill most likely never book with you again;0
i followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around your service sucks usairwayssuck;0
i dont mind waiting i mind waiting on a plane when i shouldnt have had to the airport has more room and you know food;0
that is appreciated however the system tells you call back late flightr then ends the call no need to reply thanks;0
why would you board ppl on a plane b its their turn to deice why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process;0
i tried that before using twitter also gave me no helpful information thank you anyway;0
i am sure you are sincere in your apology its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers options;0
yeah i know thatbut now ill have to spend almost dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week;0
yeah either by refunding my money or free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through;0
0;

travel week delays cancelled flightlations if you want to learn more about the merger press delay my connector in chicago deice;1
requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction;0
horrible service luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude didnt help at all;0
thats a rather clunky process whoever designed that clearly doesnt understand email;0
thanks flight today great crew;2
thank you for contacting american the email address you have written to is an unmonitored account;1
your customer relations dept has oneway email how is not allowing responses helpful;0
if you are sorry answer my claims aa ref and accordingly without using weather;0

laxogglax using hard earned miles and was given lousy service faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag your customer care;0
they were no where to be found at midnight last night i would think the agent in lax could have relayed that infobag on flt;0
you cancelled flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat not acceptable upgrade to emergency row would help nothappy;0
is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a bag and not replace and shrug the damage off flights from;0
it isnt good enough you need to provide a phone number other partners do should be investigated by;0
lol great answer our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible we appreciate your patience;1
super spring tides and tide of the century drawing tourists to french and uk coasts;1
ps i was right;1
yes it is in dulles and i need it delivered to the embassy suites in herndon va im still in chicago from the fiasco in lax;0

machines are broken lines are out the door for self service cust support and bag check in;0
would have been had i seen this before pm est when i was sound asleep;0
merged airlines do not work for ff programs very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care attitudeissues;0
you dont have those abilities anywhere not at the ticket counter at cust service or online thats why were done here;1
when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think aa would want to earn your business but guess not;0
needs to get their shit together counter people amp;0
i know your policy just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances;0
the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing just wow;0
oh no she left the counter and went downstairs then she told elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter;0
of course you are because thats your companies job you guys failed at it in the first place upgrade me and then well talk;1

no worries even though i was talking about seat assignment;2
this looks like jfk had a great pic of the oneworld jets lined up on the opposite side air berlin lan and aa;1
been trying to call all day get hung up on every time your guys are horrible;0
see james we only have dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits;0
i did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when i was at jfk a few hours ago good luck wflights;1
sitting on plane for hrs at gate due to computer sys issue at what point do you cancelled flight a flight ridiculous;0
not a valid response in for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions stop understaffing;0
yo could that be a catering truck before mine eyes unmoving;1
this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter but they cant staff a call center;0
great seats on this aircraft;2
is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at been waiting hrs and still havent even seen one plane;0
both pictures taken at the same time but which is right totallyconfused;1
aa flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a h delay and cattle treatment surreal;0
miami to rio to participate at representing yourstoryhere;1
a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight really come on;0
are you now flying s to madrid from jfk or is this dfword huge;1
the wine served in usairways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles;0
whos your pick for best picture i dont want to board your airline until i know;1
we have more passengers with me there are two more reservation numbers;0
no profit maximization is your top priority nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs;0

you have the worst customer service of any airlines ive ever encountered flat out awful;0
why dont you tweet canned impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer youve got;0

nice aa employee making skillful excuses about late flightness due to catering snafu;0
then taxi across dfw airport for min to then state min past departing from gate that we need deiced wow uncool amp;0
